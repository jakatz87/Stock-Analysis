### First Task
I created a VBA Macro, using MsgBox
### Second Task
I used the Cells and Range function, and it reminded me of VLOOKUP
### Third Task
I used For loops and conditionals to add the total traded volume for DQ and added it to the new sheet
### Fourth Task
Google code if I need to.  StackOverflow to know what code to use.  Quora to know why I'm using it.
